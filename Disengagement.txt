! Modern social media and news is designed in a way that it attempts to attract
! maximize my engagement on their site. They're effective.

! This filter list is designed to allow me to land on social media and news
! sites when Google searches, or direct links from people take me to one. They
! can have small treasure troves of useful information I don't want to be cut
! off from. But this disallows me casually browsing the headlines or getting
! caught up in a daisy chain of suggested content.
